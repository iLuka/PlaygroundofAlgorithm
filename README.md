# PlaygroundofAlgorithm
Since the mess created by this pandemic called COVID-19 and all the dramas palyed by the western countries have destroyed my original plan, i have to seriouly prepare for the back-ups. 

I have never been a guy who can stay focused, but i have to concentrate on practising my coding skills and enhance my knowledge of algorithms. Hence, i created 
this repositry to serve as a logbook recording my daily work. 

I hope this repositry could be lasting for long enough to push me study on my own.
